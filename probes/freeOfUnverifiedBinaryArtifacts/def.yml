id: freeOfUnverifiedBinaryArtifacts
short: Checks if the project has binary files in its source tree. The probe skips verified binary files which currently are gradle-wrappers.
motivation: >
  Binary files are not human readable so users and reviewers can't easily see what they do.
implementation: >
  The implementation looks for the presence of binary files that are not "verified".
  A verified binary is one that Scorecard considers valid for building and/or releasing the project.
  This is a more permissive probe than "freeOfAnyBinaryArtifacts" which does not skip verified binary files.
outcome:
  - If the probe finds unverified binary files, it returns OutcomeNegative for each unverified binary files found.
  - If the probe finds no unverified binary files, it returns OutcomePositive.
remediation:
  effort: Medium
  text:
    - Remove the generated executable artifacts from the repository.
    - Build from source.
  markdown:
    - TODO
ecosystem:
  languages:
    - all
