short: Checks that a collaborator, member or owner has participated in issues in the last 90 days.
motivation: >
  A project which is not active might not be patched, have its dependencies patched, or be actively tested and used.
  A lack of active maintenance should signal that potential users should investigate further to judge the situation. A project may not need further features or maintenance; In this case, the probe results can be disregarded.
implementation: >
  The probe checks whether collaborators, members or owners of a project have participated in issues in the last 90 days.
outcome:
  - If collaborators, members or owners have participated in issues in the last 90 days, the probe returns one OutcomePositive. The probe also returns a "numberOfIssuesUpdatedWithinThreshold" value with represents the number of issues on the repository which project collaborators, members or owners have shown activity in.
  - If collaborators, members or owners have NOT participated in issues in the last 90 days, the probe returns a single OutcomeNegative.
